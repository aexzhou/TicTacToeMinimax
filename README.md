# Smart Tic Tac Toe Opponent using the Minimax algorithm
## About
This repository contains a simple implementation of a tic-tac-toe game using both `Python` and `C++`.
You will play against the computer, who plays the best move according to the minimax algorithm.
The stucture of the code itself is separated into two classes:
- A `TicTacToe` class that handles all the game logic.
- A `Screen` class that 'fakes' GUI handling and prints stuff to the terminal. 

The method `minimax` under the `TicTacToe` class is where all the magic happens.

## Gameplay
1. The game starts off by allowing you to "flip a coin" and determine who goes first. 
2. Place your moves by entering positional numbers into the terminal according to the reference shown on screen.
